# The V1 robot code features: (in V1 folder)
  ## Main Folder Code
  All code in the Main Code folder is for uploading different binaries for the different autonomous programs of the robot. 
  
  The code is very hard to abstract with the VEX C++ API, so we were forced to brute force copy+paste the code 3+ times.
  
  Each file contains the same driver code and references the same files but has differing autonomous functions utilized to achieve different autonomous routes.
  
  ## TEST Code
  The TEST Code folder features all of the tests involved to make sure the individual parts of the robot code would work on the robot before putting it all together. 
  
  The Gyro_Test Code takes the drivercontrol routine and uses it as a task to measure the gyro output when moving the robot around by hand. The gyro output will be displayed on the LCD Screen. This is to test if the gyroscope sensor works on the robot. 
  
  The fwd_test Code is the code that tests the forward autonomous function of the robot that will be utilized a lot during autonomous. It will take the fwd_1D function and test it using a variety of arguments that will be changed by hand when running the code. 
 
  The Python Tests are projects meant to test algorithms that will be implemented for the future. The relevant python test for our V1 robot is the Motion Profile test. This test tests the motion profile algorithm. The motion profile algorithm takes a target velocity and a desired acceleration and attempts to create velocity over time graph that maps out the ramp up, cruise, and ramp down speeds over time. 
  
  The Robot_Experiments Code is a list of programs that test different kinematics of the robot. The code tests how fast the robot will go at varying voltages to the motors including the lift and chassis of robot.
  What testing the velocities of the robot at varying voltages should allow us to do is create a line of best fit using the voltages as the x-axis and the speed at the y-axis.
