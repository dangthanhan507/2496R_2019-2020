# 2496R_2019-2020
This code was used for the Beckman VEX Robotics Club for team 2496R.
The game for our season in 2019-2020 is Tower Takeover. 
The robot was a 6 wheel chassis with a double reverse 4 bar lift for the V1 code. We will call that the V1 robot.
The V2 robot was our second robot for this season which is a tray robot that places cubes using a motor that tilts the tray straight vertical.
